# CoherentFDM
A Coherent Frequency-Division Multiplex Voice Modem in Java

This was an exercise to see if I could write a DSP application in Java that operated in real-time.
The software was converted from the Codec 2 Digital Voice and Modem programs, with the goal of being native Java.

To test the modem:
Usage: java -jar FDMTest.jar filename.raw

An example hts.raw file is provided.

These programs were last compiled with JDK17 and Apache Netbeans IDE 20
